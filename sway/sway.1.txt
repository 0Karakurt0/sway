sway - SirCmpwn's Wayland window manager

Synopsis
--------
'sway' [options] [command]

Options
-------

	Show help message and quit.

*-c, \--config* <config>::
	Specifies a config file.

*-C, \--validate*::
	Check the validity of the config file, then exit.

Description
-----------

sway was created to fill the need of an i3-like window manager for Wayland. The
upstream i3 developers have no intention of porting i3 to Wayland, and projects
proposed by others ended up as vaporware. Many thanks to the i3 folks for
providing such a great piece of software, so good that your users would rather
write an entirely new window manager from scratch that behaved _exactly_ like i3
rather than switch to something else.

Launch sway directly from a tty or via your favorite Wayland-compatible login
manager.

Commands
--------

If sway is currently running, you may run _sway [command]_ to send _command_ to
the running instance of sway. The same commands you would use in the config file
are valid here (see **sway**(5)). For compatibility reasons, you may also issue
commands with **swaymsg**(1) or **i3-msg**(1) (or even with **i3**(1), probably).

Configuration
-------------

The path to a config file can be given via the _-c_ parameter, else
sway searches for it in the following locations:
- ~/.sway/config
- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/config (suggested location)
- ~/.i3/config
- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3/config (XDG_HOME )
- /etc/sway/config
- /etc/i3/config

In /etc/sway/config the standard config file is installed.
An error is raised when no config file is found.

To write your own configuration, it's suggested that you copy the default config file to
the location of your choosing and start there.

For information on the config file format, see **sway**(5).

Environment
-----------

The following environment variables have an effect on sway:

*SWAY_CURSOR_THEME*::
	Specifies the name of the cursor theme to use.

*SWAY_CURSOR_SIZE*::
	Specifies the size of the cursor to use.

*SWAYSOCK*::
	Specifies the path to the sway IPC socket.

*WLC_DRM_DEVICE*::
	Specifies the device to use in DRM mode.

*WLC_SHM*::
	Set 1 to force EGL clients to use shared memory.

*WLC_OUTPUTS*::
	Number of fake outputs to use when running in X11 mode.

*WLC_XWAYLAND*::
	Set to 0 to disable Xwayland support.

*WLC_LIBINPUT*::
	Set to 1 to force libinput (even in X11 mode).

*WLC_REPEAT_DELAY*::
	Configures the keyboard repeat delay.

*WLC_REPEAT_RATE*::
	Configures the keyboard repeat rate.

*XKB_DEFAULT_RULES*, *XKB_DEFAULT_MODEL*, *XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT*, *XKB_DEFAULT_VARIANT*, *XKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS*::
